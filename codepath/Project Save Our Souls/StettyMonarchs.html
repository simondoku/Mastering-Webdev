                The monarch butterfly is an iconic species,
                but the insect may be in trouble. 
                The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the migratory monarch butterfly as endangered.
                Mark Hunter is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Michigan. 
                He studies monarch populations on milkweed plants in Pellston, Michigan.  
                “We’ve been studying monarch populations every year for the last 50 years,” Hunter said. “We count the numbers of butterflies that arrive and we count the number of caterpillars that we find on their milkweed plants. One of the things that we noticed very quickly was when I first started, hundreds of monarchs each year you could find within five or 10 minutes, dozens of larvae, if you were good at looking.”
